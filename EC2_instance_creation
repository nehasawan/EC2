<b>EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud</b>

<b>Theory:</b>
- We get servers on rent.
eg. i asked someone for high storage and ram. i asked them to create vm and give me that vm on rent to use. 
and also give ssh access.

-What we can ask?
compute power, storage, Ram, Speed, network speed(downloading), can apply firewall rules means which traffic can get in or out.

- what we can do with instance
we can launch our application.
any machine we can add in DNS,allocate ip to it,with the help of bootstrap script

<b>Steps:</b>
1. login aws account
2. select region where u want to create instance
3. search EC2
4. launch instance-> slect machine -> select instance type -> key pair -> create ssh key
5. Network setting:
6. forewall: create security group -> allow ssh traffic from from anywhere we can give our system ip so you will only access.
7. configure storage its like c drive we have to st root volume

<b>Notes:</b>
Key pair - for security it will create ssh key -> public key will in ssh and private key will be with you.

private key formate:
.pem : mac
.ppk : below windows 10


<b>How to acces EC2 from windows:</b>
got o where ssh key file download-> go in location ->click there and type cmd
-> type command ssh -i "key_name.pem/.ppk"-> go to ec2 instance on aws click on connect -> select ssh client ->
from eg copy username -> yes -> u will enter ec2 instace

<b>some commands:</b>
#cat /stc/os-release : to check os
#fee -m : how much cpu ram is threx
#df -h : to check how much root volume is there
#ip a : to finmd private ip it is bind to public ip

<b>how u can access ssh your instance:</b>
1. using git bash/terminal
n windows ssh comand wont work:
you can use git bash-> to to download where key download -> enter that ssh command stepwise

2.from aws->
one more option u can ssh yr instance:
select instance -> click on connect -> ec2 instance connect -> enter instance username -> u can open through browser -> connect
